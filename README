Redis two-in-one consumer-worker.

This is a small application which can be both producer and consumer of messages.

As a generator it can do this:
* Generate random string message.
* Become a worker if new generator arrive in case of timeout(e.g. network lag).

As a worker it can do this:
* Consume messages (each message will be consume only once).
* Detect error in message and take it to Redis DB for future analysis.
* Become a generator if the old one is missing.

If you start an application with --getErrors key it will collect all error
messages from Redis, and empty it.

WARNING: No configs or logging available, it's kinda out of scope for this task.
